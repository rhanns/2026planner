# 2026 Planner

> **Nick Smith Disclaimer:** This README was generated by ChatGPT, I don't actually talk like this: 
> Many of the modularized files in this repository were also produced by CLAUDE AI - CHAT GPT TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR CLAUDES WORK WOW, which helped split apart an unruly, very long script into cleaner pieces. The project itself was built in a somewhat unstructured, ad-hoc way as ideas came up, and only later organized
> into modules.

## Project Notes
- Built with **React (via in-browser Babel)** and **vanilla JavaScript**.
- Styling handled with **TailwindCSS (via CDN)**.
- Code is split into multiple files for modularity:
  - `app.jsx` (main entry point / root component)
  - `PlannerView.jsx`, `AnalyticsView.jsx` (views)
  - `data.js`, `dataSchema.js`, `gardenLogic.js` (data + business logic)
  - `utils.js` (helpers)
  - `styles.css` (custom styles)

---

## Development Style
- This project grew organically: features were added as ideas came, without a strict roadmap.
- Later, the code was modularized (with ChatGPT‚Äôs help) into multiple files to make it more maintainable.
- Not all ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù are followed yet (no bundler, testing, or build pipeline).
- Current version serves as a **working, modular base** for future improvements.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Customization & Data (no backend required)
- **Bed Planner (local only)**: create/resize beds; drag/drop; MGKC beds as default; import/export JSON.
- **Vegetable Database View**: browse/edit crop info; export/import dataset.
- **Crop View & Tasks**: crop details + auto weekly To-Do list (local).
- **Companion Planting (basic)**: show compatible/incompatible crops from a static dataset.

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Accounts, Persistence & Notifications (backend)
- **User Accounts**: email/password or OAuth.
- **Permissions/Sharing**: Owner/Editor/Viewer per garden.
- **Saved Data**: beds, plantings, tasks, custom crops in DB; version history.
- **Notifications**: weekly email; optional SMS; user prefs.
- **Calendar Sync (iCal)**: generate iCal feeds per user/garden so tasks appear in Google/Apple/Outlook calendars.

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Orchard & Advanced Planning
- **Orchard Management**: trees with species/variety/age/rootstock; pruning/spray schedules; yield logging.
- **Scheduling/Climate**: frost dates + weather nudges.
- **Crop Rotation (advanced)**: track crop families; warn if rotation rules are broken; suggest alternatives.
- **Analytics**: bed utilization, successions, harvest projections; CSV export.

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Collaboration, Extensibility, Polish
- **Collab**: real-time presence, comments, soft locks.
- **Templates/Marketplace**: shareable beds/crop packs.
- **Offline & Mobile**: PWA; mobile-friendly planner.
- **A11y & i18n**: keyboard nav, contrast, locales/units.
